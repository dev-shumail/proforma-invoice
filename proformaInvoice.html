                displays on Seller Sites directed at Buyer) that the Vehicle is
                available and has been taken out of stock and reserved for
                Buyer, and that the Required Payment has been received and
                accepted by Seller. Upon the satisfaction of such Sale

                subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Without
                limiting the foregoing, Buyer understands and agrees that
                Seller’s inventory of vehicles available for sale may be
                maintained by third-party used car dealers engaged by Seller,
                and vehicles are sold on a firstcome, first-served basis.
                Accordingly, vehicles identified online through websites
                maintained by or on behalf of Seller (“Seller Sites”) may no
                longer be available at the time a Proforma Invoice is issued and
                this Agreement is entered into. Execution of this Agreement by
                Seller does not guarantee that the identified Vehicle will be in
                stock and available when the final order for such Vehicle is
                submitted, and therefore does not create any binding obligation
                on Seller to sell the Vehicle to Buyer. If the Vehicle is not
                available for purchase, then due to the failure to satisfy the
                Sale Conditions Seller will have no obligation to sell the
                Vehicle to Buyer. In such event, Seller will so notify Buyer.
                Buyer may decide to purchase an alternative vehicle from the
                Seller if such alternative vehicle is available, and such
                purchase shall be represented by a new Proforma Invoice and
                shall be subject to the terms and conditions of a new Vehicle
                Purchase Agreement for such Vehicle.<br />
                Following issuance of a Proforma Invoice, Seller may, in its
                discretion, reserve the Vehicle for Buyer for a limited time
                determined by the Seller in its sole discretion from the date of
                the Proforma Invoice issuance (the “Reservation Period”),
                provided that such reservation shall not be deemed to be
                confirmation that the Vehicle is in stock and has not been
                reserved for another buyer, and that Seller shall have no
                obligation to sell such Vehicle to Buyer unless and until all
                Sale Conditions have been fully satisfied within the Reservation
                Period. During the Reservation Period, Seller will not sell the
                Vehicle to another prospective Buyer who has been issued a
                proforma invoice for the Vehicle with a later date/time than the
                date/time of Buyer’s Proforma Invoice. If the Sale Conditions
                are not satisfied prior to the expiration of the Reservation
                Period, Seller shall not be deemed to have any obligation to
                continue to hold the Vehicle for Buyer, and Seller may sell the
                Vehicle to any other person. <br />
                Any breach of Buyer’s payment obligations, regardless of the
                reason, may automatically result in cancellation of Buyer’s
                purchase order without Buyer’s prior consent

                purchase of the Vehicle, regardless of whether or not Buyer is
                still within the Reservation Period, and in such event will not
                refund the first Installment Payment, including any other
